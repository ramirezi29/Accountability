My Triggers: Accountability Assistant provides assistance to individuals over coming addiction by adding a layer of accountability.

Addiction recovery can be difficult when the individual goes through the journey alone. Too often an individual struggling with addiction relapses when they find themselves in a familiar location where they engage in the unwanted behavior. 

My Triggers provides you a map that allows you to track the locations you are trying to avoid that might trigger relapse or any other unwanted behavior. 

As you approach the identified location a notification appears prompting you to stay away and contact your support person.

Notes, contact information and trigger locations are saved to iCloud and synched with your other iCloud enabled devices.
